**Hey there, fellow Friend.tech enthusiasts!**

I've always been super curious about blockchain and loved the idea behind Friend.tech. So, over a few weekends and countless cups of coffee, I decided to whip up a little something for all of us.

**Holdings at a Glance:**
Yeah, I know, Friend.tech is all about the numbers, therefore its important to stay up to date. Made it a bit simpler to check out your holdings with this. It's like a cozy dashboard for your assets.

**Stay Updated with Friends:**
Missed what your Hsaka bought last night? No worries. With this little tool, you can see what everyone has been up to. Never miss out again.

**Ranking and Points:**
Just a fun thing I added! See how you're doing compared to your pals. No pressure, just a light-hearted way to celebrate our little digital milestones together.

**Wallet Connection:**
I'm all about keeping things safe but simple. Easily find every wallet for the corresponding friend.tech account.

I genuinely had a blast putting this together and hope it adds a little something to your Friend.tech experience. Would love to hear your thoughts and any fun ideas you might have! Let's make our time on Friend.tech even more awesome, together. ðŸš€
